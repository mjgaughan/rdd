========

This package provides the tools to undertake estimation in Regression 
 Discontinuity Designs. Both sharp and fuzzy designs are supported. Estimation is 
 accomplished using local linear regression. A provided function will utilize 
 Imbens-Kalyanaraman optimal bandwidth calculation. A function is also included to 
 test the assumption of no-sorting effects.
